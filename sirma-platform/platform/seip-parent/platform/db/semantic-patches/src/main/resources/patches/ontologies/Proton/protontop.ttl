Although product models are rather abstract entities (generally, intangible), this class is defined as a sub-class of Object, because it has a strong temporal extent (it comes to exsitence at some point of time). There could be several information resources associated with a product model (e.g. specifications, brouchures, etc.), but it is not an information resource on its own."@en .
