## Converting .png to font icons

### 1. Convert .png images to .svg
### 2. Use any existing tool/services that convert .svg to font icon (for example: http://fontastic.me/)
### 3. Extract font .svg, .eot, .ttf, .woff, .woff2 files to desired directory.
  - ###  If needed, rename the files to more appropriate names. Also rename font-family attribute in the font-face tag in the .svg file appropriately.
### 4. Import and then include the file sources in the css and use as needed.
